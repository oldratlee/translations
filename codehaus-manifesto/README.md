## 🍎 译序

`Codehaus`是协作构建开源项目的社区，重点强烈现代语言，并开发聚焦于满足实际需求的高质量组件。

`Groovy`、`Jetty`、`Gradle`、`XStream`、`Jackson`、`Grails`、`XDoclet`、`jMock`、`EasyMock`、`QDox`、`Drools`、`Esper`、`Mule`、`Janino`、`JBehave`、`Stomp` （以及其他数以百计）这些开源项目，都得感谢`Codehaus`社区，很多项目听起来是如雷贯耳吧！

# Codehaus Manifesto

1. The Codehaus recognizes that some committers, based upon metrics, longevity and appointed management, have greater say on a project than others.  
    （谁贡献的多，谁说了算）
1. The Codehaus is a place where people are encouraged to get on with code rather than tie their projects up with bureaucracy.  
    （代码甚于流程）
1. The Codehaus encourages projects to strive for quality and for frequent small releases.  
    （讲求质量，小步快跑）
1. The Codehaus encourages committers to be respectful friends, meet up with each other as often as possible. Face-to-face is superior to email.  
    （交流靠吼，优于电邮）
1. The Codehaus stands in favour of diversity (where appropriate) over enforced convergence and homogeneity.  
    （要百花齐放，不要千篇一律）
1. The Codehaus places a high bar on entry for committers. Referral is a common means. A new committer is expected to show strong character elements as well as a talent for code. Maturity and wisdom (possibly in advance of years if a youngster) should be demonstrated.  
    （严选成员，推荐制，有实力的入）
1. New committers to an existing project are expected to ease themselves in with small and deferrent commits to start, and greater free-will may be assumed later.  
    （项目中的新客，从提交 bug ﬁx 开始，别一上来就重构优化）
1. The Codehaus places a high bar on entry for projects. They should be released or near it.  
    （严选项目，成熟的入 v0.1 的滚）
1. The Codehaus encourages people to be brief in email and to honor internet etiquette. Ten furlongs of text justifying a position is poor form; better would be a (failing) unit test.  
    （高效沟通，能用代码绝不文字）
1. In case of disagreement, The Despots are right.  
    （必要独裁）
